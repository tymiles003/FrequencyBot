> The idea behind this project aims to make automated high-frequency trades via the internet against mutliple trading API 
interfaces. This project is in its infancy stages and I'll be adding code whenever I can. Here are some of the things that
I could use some help with:

* Writing interfaces against Kraken API's, Coinbase APIs, and the various other trading platforms.
* Implementing all the trading variables for buying and selling triggers - such as:
** CurrentPrice
** PreviousPrice
** CurrentDirection (is the wave-form starting to move downwards) 

The idea being to rapidly accumulate wealth by capturing buy and sell activies on different currencies such as Ripple, Bitcoin
Stocks, Mutual Funds Etc anything that generates a sine-wave form or other type of frequency wave.
